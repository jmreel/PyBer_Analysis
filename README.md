#PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
A ride-sharing app company wanted their rideshare data analyze. The projected needed data from January to early May of 2019 and to create a compelling visualization to go along with it. After creating line, bar, scatter, and pie graphs, the CEA wanted a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Therefore, with the help of Pandas, the summary was created with a DataFrame. Once this DataFrame was created, a multiple-line graph was created to show the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

1.  Total rides: Looking at the total rides data, the most rides given were given in a higher population density area.
      - Rural: 125
      - Suburban: 625
      - Urban: 1,625

2. Total Drivers: Higher population densities will also help generate more drivers to assist with the amount of rides requested. 
      - Rural: 78
      - Suburban: 490
      - Urban: 2405

3. Total Fares: The ride-share app has generated more fares, in higher population densities. 
      - Rural: $4,327.93
      - Suburban: $ 19,356
      - Urban: $ 39,854.38

The ride-sharing data shows that there is a difference in location. There are less rides and drivers in rural populations, but this leads to higher fares. Urban populations have more rides and drivers, creating lower fare amount. 

## Summary

The PyBer Summary shows that rural areas have less rides, less drivers but a higher fare. Urban areas have the most rides, the most drivers but the lowest fare. This could be due supply and demand. There are more people who need rides in urban cities, which creates a demand. Due to a higher demand, the higher supply of drivers is needed. This also helps brings fare down. Drivers are able to make more by providing more rides in a shorted distance. Rural areas have less demand and longer distances. Therefore, if a driver wants to make more money, they must increase their price. If PyBer wants to generate more business in rural areas, they could look at increasing driver pay by using funds from urban areas to offset the driver pay so drivers do not have to charge so much per ride. PyBer could also look at creating an incentive program to bring urban and suburban drivers to rural areas. If more drivers are available, it could help provide a service to an unmet demand. Finally, if PyBer wants to increase average fare per driver, they could create a surge charge during busier hours, especially in urban areas.
